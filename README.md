# LinK: Linear Kernel for LiDAR-based 3D Perception
Tao Lu, Xiang Ding, Haisong Liu, Gangshan Wu, Limin Wang <br />

This is the official implementation of LinK, a large kernel backbone for 3D perception tasks including the 3D sementaic segmentation and object detection.

The full code is under construction and will come soon.
